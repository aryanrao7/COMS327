I decided to code four different games for this assignment using ncurses. 
Four console-based games: Tic Tac Toe (Single and Double Player), Blackjack, and Connect Four.

Getting Started
To run the games, follow these steps:

Open a terminal window.
Navigate to the root directory of the project.
Execute the following commands:

1. make
2. ./games
This will compile the code using the make command and then run the games executable.

Game Menu
After running the games executable, a menu will be displayed where you can select the game you want to play:

Tic Tac Toe (Single Player)
Tic Tac Toe (Two Players)
Blackjack
Connect Four
Enter the corresponding number for the game you wish to play.

Game Files
The source code for each game is organized into separate files:

Tic Tac Toe
Files: games.cpp, player.h, player.cpp, tictactoe.cpp, tictactoe.h
How to Play:
Single Player: Play against a computer opponent.
Two Players: Play against a friend.

Blackjack
File: blackjack.cpp
How to Play: Follow the on-screen instructions to play Blackjack.

Connect Four
File: connect.cpp
How to Play: Follow the on-screen instructions to play Connect Four.
