In the first week I generated random maps with all the required functionalities. Last week I have used the exits/gates to connect to other maps.							

I have also used Professors code solution for Assignment 1.01. I understood the Dijkstras Algorithm and wanted to use that. I have added my required functions for this
weeks assignment on top of that.	

This week I have made the path finding algorithms. Defined the travel times and costs as per the required document.

Steps to run:

- 'make' will run the makefile
- './pathFind' will start the application, generating the maps
