In the first week I generated random maps with all the required functionalities. This week I have used the exits/gates to connect to other maps.							

I have also used Professors code solution for Assignment 1.01. I understood the Dijkstras Algorithm and wanted to use that. I have added my required functions for this
weeks assignment on top of that.	

Steps to run:

- 'make' will run the makefile
- './map2map' will start the application, followed by the commands

The commands are:
• n/N: Move to the map immediately north of the current map and display it.
• s/S: Move to the map immediately south of the current map and display it.
• e/E: Move to the map immediately east of the current map and display it.
• w/W: Move to the map immediately west of the current map and display it.
• f x y: x and y are integers; Fly2 to map (x, y) and display it.
• q: Quit the game.
