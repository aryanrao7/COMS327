- Started working on new_map to calculate distance and probability
- 'dist' represents distance: This variable is used to calculate the distance between the current map's center (at world.latest_index[dim_x] and world.latest_index[dim_y]) and the overall center of the map (MAP_SIZE / 2). It is used to determine how far the current map is from the map's center. By naming it d, it's clear that this variable is related to distance.
- 'prob' represents probability: This variable is used to calculate the probability of certain events happening (specifically, the events of placing a pokemart and a center on the map). The probability is calculated based on the distance d. By naming it p, it's clear that this variable is related to probability.
